    <p><b>SOFTWARE OVERVIEW:</b></p>
    <p>As a software engineer, I am continuously expanding my expertise, with a particular focus on database management and cybersecurity. I am currently deepening my knowledge in database systems, learning about data integrity, optimization techniques, and scalable architecture. This involves mastering various database technologies, including relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as NoSQL solutions such as MongoDB.

      <p>In parallel, I am immersing myself in cybersecurity principles to ensure that the systems I develop are not only functional but also secure. This includes studying topics such as threat modeling, encryption, and network security. By understanding vulnerabilities and implementing robust security measures, I aim to protect data and systems from potential threats.</p>
      
      <p>My commitment to these areas reflects my dedication to delivering well-rounded, secure, and efficient software solutions. As I progress, I look forward to integrating these skills into real-world projects, contributing to both the safety and effectiveness of the technology I work with.</p>

  <p><b>AWS & AZURE:</b></p>
  <div class="paragraph-container1">
    <p class="moving-square-paragraph1">Currently, I have hosted a handful of websites utilizing AWS services 
      and their S3 functionalities. I love the process of creating something in Python or HTML and then 
      deploying it to the real internet to bring it to life with actual functionality. With <b>2 years</b> of 
      experience working with these services, I have developed a deep understanding of Cloud Foundations, 
      including the various services and software required for creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or 
      virtual environments. 
      <p>My hands-on experience with AWS has honed my skills in managing cloud 
      infrastructure, optimizing performance, and ensuring security. I am enthusiastic about applying this
