  <p><b>SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE:</b></p>
<div class="paragraph-container1">
  <p class="moving-square-paragraph1">With over <b>1 year</b> of management training at Ivy Tech and with 
  strictly "A" averages under my belt, I quickly grasped the importance of management when creating and 
engineering projects to bring forth to the public. My professor adored my skills in management and how I 
seemlessly brought those skills to the tech industry. Our teams in management worked well in Agile enviorments, 
with glooming deadlines. Our team always broke through and typically was early with delivering most projects.
</p>
  <p>In my management courses, I excelled by leveraging ERDs to design and create effective databases, applying Agile methodologies to streamline project workflows, and collaborating closely with a dedicated and committed team. Our proactive approach and strong teamwork contributed to achieving solid A's in the courses, reflecting our ability to effectively manage and execute complex projects. Working together, we consistently met deadlines and delivered high-quality results, showcasing our combined skills and dedication. This experience solidified my understanding of database management and reinforced my passion for working collaboratively in high-stakes environments.

<p><b>WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE:</b></p>
<div class="paragraph-container">
  <p class="moving-square-paragraph">My time at <b>UPS</b> was spent tracking the progress of every employee 
    within the UPS hub and reported documented information to management for reviewed while maintaining
     an updated database on each individual employee progress with the company.</p>
  <p>Created excel documents for every employee about tardiness, lateness, and work ethic. Suggested and offered innovative ideas for unique events for employee appreciation. Worked as a team to ensure the dissemination of correct information from management.</p>
  <div class="moving-square"></div>
</div>
  <p>At <b>MAPCO </b> I maintained a clean and operational convenient store, and supplied the stores with all it's needs and 
    operational tasks. Submitted payroll, work receipts and vendor orders. Compiled monthly records of store 
    sales. Tracked completion of assigned tasks for each employee and attended weekly conference calls with 
    neighboring districts to discuss upcoming events. Followed prescribed store layouts for new products and 
    their correct placement also monitored security cameras to watch for and prevent theft within the store.
    Worked with vendors when bringing in weekly deliveries and completed work orders and returns for store 
    merchandise. Offered my assistance and aided other stores within the district, or in other districts, 
    due to staffing shortages.

  <p><b>FOOD CERTIFICATION EXPERIENCE:</b></p>
  <p>I've worked at <b>TACOBELL</b> for a while, when I was a kid in highschool I got my first job here and through time I became a manager at this company. Working through Covid-19, going through school, I somehow made it through those difficult times and got and education at the other end of it.</p>

  <p>
  <div class="paragraph-container1">
    <p class="moving-square-paragraph1">I had the opportunity to train new hires and existing team members on
       essential operations and collaborated with managers to address various store related concerns. My responsibilities 
       included creating and managing shift schedules and work assignments, ensuring that food preparation was 
       timely and aligned with customer needs. I also hold a Food Safety certification, which underscores my 
       commitment to maintaining high standards in food handling and preparation.
